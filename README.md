If you have a passion for merging technology with creativity, we want to hear from you!
================
To create an AI-driven music composition system using Python, you can use Magenta, a framework developed by Google that uses machine learning to generate music. Magenta has a variety of pre-trained models for different tasks like generating melodies, harmonies, and more. In this example, we'll create a simple AI music composition tool that generates music using a pre-trained model.

Requirements:

    Magenta for music generation.
    TensorFlow as the backend for Magenta.
    Piano-midi-parser (for handling MIDI data) if needed.

Step 1: Install Dependencies

You need to install Magenta and TensorFlow if you haven't already:

pip install magenta
pip install tensorflow

Step 2: Basic Python Code for Music Generation

Below is a Python script to generate music using Magenta. We'll use the Melody RNN model, which is pre-trained for melody generation.

import magenta
from magenta.models.melody_rnn import melody_rnn_generate
from magenta.models.shared import sequence_proto_to_midi
from magenta.models.melody_rnn import melody_rnn_config
from magenta.protobuf import generator_pb2
from magenta.protobuf import music_pb2
import tensorflow as tf

# Set up the model and config for Melody RNN
def create_melody_rnn_model():
    # Configuration of Melody RNN
    melody_rnn_config = melody_rnn_config.default_configs['basic_rnn']
    melody_rnn_model = melody_rnn_generate.MelodyRnnModel(melody_rnn_config)
    return melody_rnn_model

# Function to generate a melody
def generate_melody(model, primer_sequence, total_steps=128):
    # Setup the generation parameters
    generator_options = generator_pb2.GeneratorOptions()
    generator_options.args['temperature'].float_value = 1.0  # The "creativity" of the generated music
    generator_options.generate_sections.add(start_time=primer_sequence.total_time, end_time=primer_sequence.total_time + total_steps)

    # Generate music
    sequence = model.generate(primer_sequence, generator_options)
    return sequence

# Convert the generated sequence to a MIDI file
def sequence_to_midi(sequence, output_filename="generated_melody.mid"):
    # Convert the sequence to MIDI
    midi = sequence_proto_to_midi.sequence_proto_to_midi(sequence)
    
    # Save the MIDI to file
    with open(output_filename, 'wb') as midi_file:
        midi_file.write(midi)
    print(f"Generated MIDI file saved as {output_filename}")

# Loading a pre-trained model and generating music
def generate_music():
    # Load pre-trained melody RNN model
    model = create_melody_rnn_model()
    
    # Define primer sequence (initial melody to start the generation)
    primer_sequence = music_pb2.NoteSequence()
    
    # You can define your own initial melody here if needed
    primer_sequence.notes.add(pitch=60, start_time=0.0, end_time=0.5, velocity=80)  # C4 note
    
    # Generate melody
    generated_sequence = generate_melody(model, primer_sequence)
    
    # Convert generated sequence to MIDI and save
    sequence_to_midi(generated_sequence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    generate_music()

Explanation of the Code:

    Magenta Setup: We are using the Melody RNN model from the Magenta framework. The model will be used to generate a melody starting from an initial seed note.

    Creating the Model: create_melody_rnn_model() sets up the configuration and initializes the model.

    Generating Music: The function generate_melody() takes a primer sequence (which is an initial set of notes or melody) and generates a new melody based on it.

    Conversion to MIDI: After generating the music, the sequence_to_midi() function converts the generated sequence into a MIDI file, which can be played using any standard music player or DAW.

    Primer Sequence: A simple C4 note (pitch=60) is used as a starting point. You can modify this primer to start with a custom melody or chord.

Step 3: Running the Code

    Once the script is executed, it will generate a melody starting with a C4 note (middle C).
    The generated music will be saved as generated_melody.mid in the current directory.

Optional Enhancements:

    Advanced Inputs: You can provide more complex primer sequences, such as a sequence of notes that you want the AI to build upon.

    Genre-Specific Models: Magenta also provides models for different styles of music (e.g., jazz, classical), which you can explore if you're looking for genre-specific compositions.

    Further Customization: You can modify the parameters of the generator_options to tweak the style, structure, and creativity of the generated music (e.g., adjusting the temperature for more creative outputs).

    Visualization: After generating the MIDI file, you could visualize it using mido, pretty_midi, or other libraries for a more detailed analysis of the composition.

Conclusion

This basic example demonstrates how to use Magenta to generate music with an AI model. By leveraging machine learning and AI models, you can compose unique music tracks that adhere to various styles or moods. You can continue to refine and customize this tool for your own music composition needs.
